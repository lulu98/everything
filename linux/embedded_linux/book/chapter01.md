# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Why Linux?

Reasons for popularity of Linux:
- vast variety of hardware devices
- vast variety of applications and networking protocols
- Linux is scalable
- no royalties requires compared to traditional proprietary embedded operating
systems
- big development community
- big number of hardware and software vendors

## Open Source and GPL

- Linux is open source
- licensed under GPL (General Public License)
- GPL = free software as in freedom but not price, i.e. free download but
substantial development costs
- if software is released under GPL, it must always carry that license
- GPL grants unlimited distribution rights without having to pay royalties -> but
vendors can still charge for GPL software, but once in possession of GPL software,
it is permissible to modify and redistribute it.  

GPL characteristics:
- the license is self-perpetuating
- the license grants the user freedom to run the program
- the license grants the user the right to study and modify the source code
- the license grants the user permission to distribute the original code and his
modifications
- the license is viral -> same rights to everyone you distribute GPL software

GPL costs:
- costs of acquisition, integration, modification, maintenance, and support
- cost of obtaining and maintaining a properly configured toolchain, libraries,
application programs, and specialized cross-development tools compatible with
chosen architecture

## Standards and Relevant Bodies

### Linux Standard Base (LSB)

- goal: establish a set of standards designed to enhance the interoperability
of applications among different Linux distributions
- LSB spans several architectures, e.g. IA32/64, Power Architecture 32- and
64-bit, AMD64 etc
- LSB specifies common attributes of a Linux distribution, e.g. object format,
standard library interfaces, a minimum set of commands and utilities and their
behavior, file system layout, system initialization

### Linux Foundation

- non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux
- sponsors the work of Linux Torvalds (creator of Linux)
- sponsors several working groups to define standards and participate in the
development of important new features

#### Carrier Grade Linux workshop
- defines set of requirements for carrier-class equipment -> reliability,
availablity, serviceability,...

#### Mobile Linux Initiative (Moblin)
- accelerate the adoption of Linux on next-generation mobile handsets and other
converged voice/data portable devices
- development tools, I/O and networking, memory management, multimedia, performance,
power management, security and storage

#### Service Availability Forum (SA Forum)
- defines a common set of interfaces for use in carrier-grade and other commercial
equipment for system management
